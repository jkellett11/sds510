"@wendigo totally. Yeah, I was gonna wait but I'm forcing myself to go, if I miss it in theaters, this is one I'd be pissed haha. Normally I barely care. Didn't even see the last Deadpool in theaters, which is rare for us haha. We saw the first 2 that way. We've seen every Star Wars thing that way, too- but we don't get out to the theaters much. One right next to our house at the casino, too. At least this one is coming there- wasn't sure it would because it's not an AMC or Harkins or anything. Last things we saw there I think was Godzilla x Kong and the Mario one.. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice was at another theater, further away, like 30-40 mins."
